### ‚ú® Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple yet elegant way to display the current time with smooth, modern animations. The backend is powered by Flask, which serves the frontend and provides a simple API endpoint to fetch the current time. The frontend, built with vanilla JavaScript, polls this endpoint and dynamically updates the DOM to create the sliding clock effect.
