🕰️ Sliding Clock Python Project 🐍
    

A sleek and modern sliding clock application built with a Python Flask backend and a dynamic JavaScript frontend. This project demonstrates a simple yet elegant way to display the current time with smooth animations.

✨ Features
Dynamic Time Updates: Fetches the current time from the server without page reloads.
Smooth Sliding Animation: Digits slide gracefully to display the current time.
12-Hour Format: Displays time in a familiar AM/PM format.
Minimalist UI: Clean and focused design that's easy on the eyes.
Separation of Concerns: A Flask backend API provides the time, while the frontend handles the display.
